**Problem Statement**     

Frontline teams at United Airlines are responsible for ensuring every flight departs on
time and is operationally ready. However, not all flights are equally easy to manage.
Certain flights pose greater complexity due to factors such as limited ground time,
higher volumes of checked or carry-on baggage, and specific customer service needs
that often increase with passenger load.
Currently, identifying these high-difficulty flights relies heavily on personal experience
and local team knowledge. This manual approach is inconsistent, non-scalable, and
risks missing opportunities for proactive resource planning across the airport.
To address this, you are tasked with developing a Flight Difficulty Score that
systematically quantifies the relative complexity of each flight using the datasets
provided, which span two weeks of departures from Chicago Oâ€™Hare International
Airport (ORD).    

*Objective*
The goal is to design a data-driven framework that:
*Calculates a Flight Difficulty Score for each flight using flight-level, customer, and
station-level data.
*Identifies the primary operational drivers contributing to flight difficulty to enable
proactive planning and optimized resource allocation.
